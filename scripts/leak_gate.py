"""Leak gate — this repo is public, so nothing internal may live in it.

Scans every tracked file for two classes of thing that must never appear here:

  1. Structural patterns — concrete internal infrastructure identifiers (a specific
     serving hostname, a private repo reference). Written as plaintext regexes because
     they describe a *shape*, not a secret.

  2. Denylisted terms — internal project/model jargon. Stored as sha256 digests in
     scripts/leak_terms.sha256, never as plaintext. A public file listing our internal
     terms would be a map of what to grep our history for. This is obscurity, not
     secrecy: short tokens are brute-forceable given the digests. The point is that the
     public repo does not *advertise* the terms.

The plaintext term list and the regeneration command live in the private portal repo at
wiki/operating-docs/leak-gate-terms.txt.

What this gate deliberately does NOT flag: vendor names on their own. The SDK already
talks to a Railway-hosted API in public code, so "we use Modal / GCS / Railway" is not
the secret — *which app, which bucket, which workspace* is. A bare `modal.run` mention
passes; `<workspace>--<app>.modal.run` does not.

Usage:
    python scripts/leak_gate.py              # scan tracked files, exit 1 on any finding
    python scripts/leak_gate.py --self-test  # prove the gate can still fail

Escape hatch: put `leak-gate-allow` in a comment on the offending line, and say why in
the PR. Use it for lines that assert we *don't* leak, not to wave through real residue.
